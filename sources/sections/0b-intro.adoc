== Introduction

<<ISO8601>> has been the international standard for date and time representations
and is applied widely, including in the <<RFC5545>> and <<RFC6350>> standards.

However, the representations provided in <<ISO8601>> require
fixed-length digits for time scale components, such as the
4-digit year, does not accept negative values, and does not
allow omission of a time scale component that has a zero value.

This document extends the "`duration`" representation
defined in <<ISO8601>> to fulfill the need of a flexible-length
representation, called the "`explicit form`".

== Scope

The purpose of this document is to provide:

* a standard, declarative representation of date and time and time
  scale components called the "`explicit form`";

* a grouped time scale unit mechanism for grouping of date and time;
  and

* new duration representations and mechanics for the calculation of
  date time formulas involving duration.

This document only supports date elements from the Gregorian calendar and
times from the 24-hour clock.

Date and time format representations described in this document
utilizes numbers, alphabets and symbols defined in <<ISOIEC646>>.
These representations are meant to be both human recognizable and
machine readable. Character encoding of the representations is
not covered in this document.
